# Limit Checker
NASA core Flight System Limit Checker Application

## Description
The Limit Checker application (LC) is a core Flight System (cFS) application that is a plug in to the Core Flight Executive (cFE) component of the cFS.

The cFS is a platform and project independent reusable software framework and set of reusable applications developed by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. This framework is used as the basis for the flight software for satellite data systems and instruments, but can be used on other embedded systems. More information on the cFS can be found at [http://cfs.gsfc.nasa.gov](http://cfs.gsfc.nasa.gov)

The LC application monitors telemetry data points in a cFS system and compares the values against predefined threshold limits. When a threshold condition is encountered, an event message is issued and a Relative Time Sequence (RTS) command script may be initiated to respond/react to the threshold violation.
