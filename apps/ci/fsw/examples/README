This directory holds example implementations of the custom layer for this application.

To make use of an example, use the setup.sh 
> ./setup.sh -h

The normal setup is to copy the files in the appropriate locations and then modify then
according to your mission needs.
For the "ci_lab" application equivalent, use the udp example.
>./setup.sh udp

You can link to files in the examples in this directory rather than making copies 
by using the -l option
>./setup.sh -l udp


DEVELOPERS NOTE:
1. Always revert back to the udp example as a copy (not a link) before comitting to 
the repo if you made changes to example files. 
We want to keep the udp to_custom.c as the default example.
>./setup.sh udp

2. If you add examples, make sure to name the directory the same in both CI & TO. 


USEFUL TIP: 
Add the following to your .bashrc to update both CI/TO at the same time:

setCustomLink() {
    cd ${MISSION_HOME}/apps/ci/fsw/examples/
    ./setup.sh -l $1
    cd ${MISSION_HOME}/apps/to/fsw/examples/
    ./setup.sh -l $1
}

setCustomCopy() {
    cd ${MISSION_HOME}/apps/ci/fsw/examples/
    ./setup.sh $1
    cd ${MISSION_HOME}/apps/to/fsw/examples/
    ./setup.sh $1
}
