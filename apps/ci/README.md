Command Ingest

NASA core Flight System Scheduler Application

Description

Command Ingest (CI) application is a core Flight System (cFS) application that is a plug in to the Core Flight Executive (cFE) component of the cFS.

The cFS is a platform and project independent reusable software framework and set of reusable applications developed by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. This framework is used as the basis for the flight software for satellite data systems and instruments, but can be used on other embedded systems. More information on the cFS can be found at http://cfs.gsfc.nasa.gov

The Command Ingest (CI) Application is responsible for receiving commands from an external source (such as a ground station) over a transport channel, and to forward the command to the appropriate application over the cFE Software Bus (SB).
