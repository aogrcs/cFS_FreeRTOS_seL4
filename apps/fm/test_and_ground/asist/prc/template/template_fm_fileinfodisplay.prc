proc $sc_$cpu_fm_fileinfodisplay (filename, crcVal, expResult)
;==============================================================================
;
; Purpose: The purpose of this procedure is to perform the file info
;          cmd and then write the contents of the packet to the log.
;
; Waring:  It is advised that before running a fresh procedure that calls this
;          to initialize the telemetry points P08Bscnt, P18Bscnt, & P28Bscnt 
;          to 0 so that a previous proc run does not interfere with whether
;          the packet is viewed as stale or not 
;
; History:
;       Date       Name         Description
;	07/31/08   D. Stewart	Initial development of this proc.
;       02/28/11   W. Moleski   Added variables for App name and ram directory
;       05/09/12   W. Moleski   Added check of ChildCMDPC and ChildCMDEC
;	01/19/17   W. Moleski	Added print of File permissions
