NASA core Flight System Software Bus Network Application

## Description
The Software Bus Network application (SBN) is a core Flight System (cFS) application that is a plug in to the Core Flight Executive (cFE) component of the cFS.

The cFS is a platform and project independent reusable software framework and set of reusable applications developed by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. This framework is used as the basis for the flight software for satellite data systems and instruments, but can be used on other embedded systems. More information on the cFS can be found at [http://cfs.gsfc.nasa.gov](http://cfs.gsfc.nasa.gov)

The SBN application extends the cFE Software Bus (SB) publish/subscribe messaging service across partitions, processes, processors, and networks.

The SBN is prototype code and requires a patch to the cFE Software Bus code.
